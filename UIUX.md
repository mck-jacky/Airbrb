1. Match between system and the real world
- We have used metaphors wisely that are understandable and translatable to the users.
- We have added an icon to describe an action. For example, a trash bin icon next to delete.
- It can increase the effectiveness of a design because the design becomes more intuitive, and users can understand how to use it easily.

2. Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from erros
- Our design will react to the users' actions. For example, the system will show errors when users have invalid input.

3. Consistency and Standards
- We have consistency with other pages of the system. For example, we use pink colour as the theme colour and blue colour in the modal.
- Also, we use a standard layout, such as putting a nav bar on the top of the page and the main content in the centre. 
- It helps users understand what they can do since they can build on the knowledge they have acquired elsewhere.

4. Visibility of System Status
- We added a loading animation when the system fetches data from the backend server.
- Users can feel in control when they are using the product, and they will feel rewarded and safe. 

5. Assistive technology
- We have added an aria-label in different elements. Users with visual impairment can still use screen readers to use our product.

6. Colour Contrast
- We have enough colour contrast between the background colour and text. People with colour blindness can still use our design smoothly.
